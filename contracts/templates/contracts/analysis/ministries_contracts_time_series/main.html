                By European law, portuguese public entities must publish their contracts in an
                <a href="{{ url }}">official public database</a>. With this database,
                we posed the question: when do portuguese ministries contract most?

                We picked all contracts of all ministries and grouped then by the month of <strong>signing date</strong>.
                Here is the result:

                    The database only started to be populated from 2008, when European Union law came into effect.
                    To some extent, this explains the sudden increase during 2008-2009.

                    We are not using the sum of values (€) of the contracts.
                    The argument is that values are unbounded:
                    one single contract can make a particular month to have a arbitrary large value.
                    (For experts:) the reason is that the variance of the sum of values can be
                    unbounded because the distribution of values is broad.

                    We have no explanation why there is a consistent increase since the beginning of 2013,
                    which is already the double of the average value over the last 3 years.
