                By European law, portuguese public entities must publish their contracts in an
                <a href="{{ url }}">official public database</a> within 10 days after it is signed.
                We question: how many contracts are published outside this interval?

                We picked all contracts in the database and count how many of then were signed on each month,
                and how many were added to the official database with more than 10 days from signing date.
                Here is the result:

                    Because the database contains only a percentage of all contracts (not every contract is published),
                    one important assumption is that this percentage does not strongly depend on the signing date.

                    We are not using the sum of values (â‚¬) of the contracts.
                    The argument is that values are unbounded:
                    one single contract can make a particular month to have a arbitrary large value.
                    (For experts:) the reason is that the variance of the sum of values can be
                    unbounded because the distribution of values is broad.

                We see that the application of the law was mainly improved during 2009, and now more than 99%
                of all published contracts comply to this point of the law.

        <p>
            {% blocktrans %}
                While this does not mean that the law of public contracts is being applied in 99% of the cases,
                it shows that the 10 days requirement is being fulfilled 99% of the cases.
