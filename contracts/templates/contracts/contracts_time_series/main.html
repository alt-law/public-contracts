                By European law, portuguese public entities must publish their contracts in an
                <a href="{{ url }}">official public database</a>. With this database,
                we posed the question: when Portugal contract most?

        <p>
            {% blocktrans %}
                We picked all contracts in that database and count how many of then were signed on each month.
                Here is the result:

                The database only started to be populated in 2008-2009. This is consistent with
                the time the portuguese law of public procurements came into effect.

                {% blocktrans %}
                    Because the database contains only a percentage of all contracts (not every contract is published),
                    one important assumption is that this percentage does not strongly depend on the signing date.

                    We are not using the sum of values (â‚¬) of the contracts.
                    The argument is that values are unbounded:
                    one single contract can make a particular month to have a arbitrary large value.
                    (For experts:) the reason is that the variance of the sum of values can be
                    unbounded because the distribution of values is broad.

                We see that there is a non-negligible peak in september of 2009, and we now show that
                it is due to a portuguese municipal election in that month.
                To that, we divide all contracts in two: the ones made only by municipalities, and the ones
                made only by non-municipalities.

                    In <a href="{{ the_url }}">this analysis</a> we justify that this graph is consistent
                    with the existence of two municipal elections, one in 10-2009 and other in 10-2013.

            {% blocktrans %}
                If we exclude all contracts from municipalities, this peak disappears, showing that
                municipal elections have a considerable influence on municipalities procurement,
                which, in turn, considerably influences the overall portuguese procurement statistics.
