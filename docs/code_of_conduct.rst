Code of conduct
===================

The information we provide gives us some power. Here we advocate our responsibilities.

Most people don't have the time nor skills to scrutinize our analysis, and our analysis are not peer reviewed by
specialists in the field. This means that they do not follow a scientific procedure.

The analysis we provide can be easily be used to support claims about specific public or private entities.
In any circumstance we do such claims in our website.
The website is a place for learning and not to form a political agenda.

Our objective, besides providing the API, is to analyze the database. We try to always
state the main assumptions of our work, and we try to address their main criticisms.

This doesn't mean other people can use our API for forming a political agenda. We can't control that.
