What is this?
---------------

Each public entity of an european country (EU) has to publicly disclose the contracts they have made.
These are stored in a publicly available database.

Public contracts is a pilot project for collaborative analysis and visualisation of databases of public contracts.
In this pilot, we use the portuguese database.

We build and maintain an open source website and API for querying the database.
Specifically, this project consists on the following components:

- A database driven by Django ORM of portuguese public contracts, remotely accessible.
- An API for querying the database using Django and Python.
- A website for visualizing the database and sharing statistical features of it.

For whom?

This project targets companies, organizations, scientists, programmers and any one interested
in the topic of public expenses.
